# ⚠️ DEPRECATED
Note that the tutorials here are specific to the `0.18` release of wasmCloud. As we release the new `0.50+` host runtime, these tutorials have become outdated. 
In the future these tutorials are likely to be deleted or to move to a new location as we pick an alternative learning resource to Katacoda. All of our
documentation and READMEs will be updated accordingly when the change occurs.
