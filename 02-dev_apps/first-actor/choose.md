# Choose your adventure

To demonstrate how wasmCloud leverages the powerful polyglot nature of WebAssembly, we have provided you with three identical calculators, written in three different languages. Throughout the tutorial, you will see sections similiar to this one:

<details>
  <summary>Rust</summary>

`cd rust`{{execute}}

</details>
<details>
  <summary>Go</summary>

`cd go`{{execute}}

</details>
<details>
  <summary>Assembly Script</summary>

`cd assemblyscript`{{execute}}

</details>

Make sure that if you use the "click & execute" capabilities of Katacoda, you stick with the same language drop downs all the way through the tutorial.

Awesome! Lets get started....select a language above and `cd` into the directory
