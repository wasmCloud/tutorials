## wash claims

The `wash claims` subcommand is used for generating and managing JWTs for wasmcloud actors.

### wash claims sign

The `wash claims sign` command allows the user to sign a wasm file and couple it with `wasmcloud` capabilities.

> Note: We have included an unsigned `wasm` module within the Katacoda environment named `table_tennis.wasm`. In a different tutorial, we will edit this file, resign it, and deploy the changes without downtime!

#### Example

`claims sign ./table_tennis.wasm -c wasmcloud:httpserver --name "demo" --ver 0.1.0 --rev 0`{{execute}}

The newly signed file will be along side the .wasm file with a `_s` appended to the file name. In this example, we now have `./table_tennis_s.wasm` (as seen in the wash output). Using the `inspect` command, we can see the new capabilities we added!

### wash claims inspect

The `wash claims inspect` command allows the user to view metadata about signed wasmcloud actors.

#### Example

`claims inspect ./table_tennis_s.wasm`{{execute}}

```bash
‚ùØ wash claims inspect ./table_tennis_s.wasm

##### Important Fields

`Module` -> This module token will be how you reference the module within the wasmcloud ecosystem.  
`Capabilities` -> This list shows what capability providers the actor will be allowed to talk to. In this example, the `table_tennis` actor can only communicate with the `HTTP Server` provider. A full list of capabilities can be found [here](https://github.com/wasmCloud/capability-providers#latest-versions).
