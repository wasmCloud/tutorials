## From sketch to scale, IN SECONDS!

Thanks for trying out `wasmcloud`! While our environment bootstraps, lets discuss the some of the core fundamentals motivating `wasmcloud`

- Polyglot Platform
  Building on the [polyglot](https://`wasmcloud`.dev/app-dev/create-actor/) power of WebAssembly, you can create actors in AssemblyScript, TinyGo, or Rust.
- Pleasantly Portable
  `wasmcloud` provides a WebAssembly application runtime so you can run your applications everywhere - servers, clients, hosts, IOS, web browsers, IOT or where ever WebAssembly executes. For more on this, check out the [documentation](https://`wasmcloud`.dev/overview/installation/).
- Completely Connected
  `wasmcloud` comes out of the box bundled with [Lattice](https://`wasmcloud`.dev/reference/lattice/) - a self-forming, self-healing mesh network that provides a unified, flattened topology across any number of disparate environments, clouds, browsers, or even hardware. No firewalls. No port forwarding. It just works.
- Securely Scalable
  `wasmcloud` embraces a [deny by default](https://`wasmcloud`.dev/reference/host-runtime/security/) paradigm - actors are only permitted to access capabilities they have been explicity granted permission to leverage. With `wasmcloud`, ALL code is untrusted code.
- Rapid Development
  `wasmcloud` leverages contract driven development and an [actor](https://`wasmcloud`.dev/reference/host-runtime/actors/) model to separate your business logic from implementation. Define your schema and `wasmcloud` scaffolds your project for you.

Now that you understand the motivation, lets start using the platform!
