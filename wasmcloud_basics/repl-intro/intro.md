## Why wash
`wash` is a bundle of command line tools that, together, form a comprehensive CLI for [wasmcloud](https://github.com/wasmcloud/wasmcloud) development. Everything from generating signing keys to a fully interactive REPL environment is contained within the subcommands of `wash`. Our goal with `wash` is to encapsulate our tools into a single binary to make developing WebAssembly with wasmcloud painless and simple.
